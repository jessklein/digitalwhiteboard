Still in very early alpha stages of development. Previous technology/security restrictions for target system deployment no longer a concern, so reworking prior code to be more efficient and dynamic.

Current tasks:
* Clean up CSS file structure
* Develop admin dashboard and secure login functionality

Upcoming tasks:
* Develop database architecture and dashboard employee submission/management forms
* Develop dashboard widgets for determining workflow assignment headers/sections
* Develop front-end for db calls of widgets displaying workflow assignment sections and individual employee tiles as specified by admin user in dashboard
