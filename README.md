Still in very early alpha stages of development. Previous technology/security restrictions for target system deployment no longer a concern, so reworking prior code to be more efficient and dynamic.

Current tasks:
* Clean up CSS file structure
* Develop admin dashboard and secure login functionality
* Convert staff list display to "tag cloud" like structure

Upcoming tasks:
* Develop database architecture and dashboard employee submission/management forms
* Develop dashboard widgets for determining workflow assignment headers/sections
* Develop front-end for db calls of widgets displaying workflow assignment sections and individual employee tiles as specified by admin user in dashboard

Usage:
Admin users (managers, supervisors, etc) will manage staff task allocation via the admin dashboard and save (publish) changes to a front end accessible by all staff

Dashboard provides functionality to manage (add, edit, remove) staff members, drag and drop staff "tiles" to task assignments

Manage task assignment categories and functions via widgets
